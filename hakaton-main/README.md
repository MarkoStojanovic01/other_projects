Student Blockades Web Platform â€“ Hackathon Project

This project was developed as part of a faculty-organized hackathon, where our team of four created a web platform focused on student blockades.
The platform serves as an informational hub for students to learn about different groups participating in blockade activities at the faculty.

A key feature of the platform is a personality test powered by machine learning, which analyzes user responses to recommend the most suitable student group 
based on their interests and values. Our goal was to enhance student engagement by making it easier to find and join relevant initiatives.

The project was built using React, Tailwind CSS, Flask, and Python, combining modern web development with machine learning for personalized recommendations. 
The focus was on usability, accessibility, and a seamless user experience.
